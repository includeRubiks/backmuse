# Gyatify
## Background music for all
Have you ever been working, and thought you needed some music? I know I have.
So like programmers do, I decided to make a background music app, and hence, this repo was born.
Also the name is cause I'm gen-alpha.
## Noob's guide
Clone this repo using the url above but add ".git" at the end. Put the mp3s in the mp3s folder and run main.py for
Gyatify.
## Note
Delete mp3s/deleteme.txt ASAP, as it is a placeholder to let github know that the mp3s folder exists
